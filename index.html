          <h2>Skills and Interests</h2>
		  <p>Microsoft Office and OpenOffice.org suites, Spanish (conversational), proficient with Microsoft and Linux operating systems and associated programs, familiar with Apple OS enough to use it, playing devil's advocate with life problems to see how I can improve on things, outgoing personality and resourceful.</p>
		  <p>It's worth noting that I used to run a social networking site that was moderately successful, although it was over 10 years ago, so my web development skills have decreased quite a bit. I mainly use command-line tools in Bash when it comes to scripting, but I can certainly refresh my memory on web development as well given a little time.</p>
